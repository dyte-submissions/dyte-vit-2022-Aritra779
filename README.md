<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
<b>The Documentation will be updated later.</b>
<br/>
<b>Currently works with only github.</b>
<b>Currently works for versions with '^' AND '~' notation. Compatibility update coming soon.</b>
<br/>
Here's a blank template to get started: To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace with your text editor for the following: `github_username`, `repo_name`, `twitter_handle`, `linkedin_username`, `email_client`, `email`, `project_title`, `project_description`

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

* [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
* [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Angular](https://angular.io/)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* node
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```

### Installation

1. Get your personal access token from github(required only when using the -u option. not required for the -i option). Follow this for creating your PAT [https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dyte-submissions/dyte-vit-2022-Aritra779.git
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Enter your PAT in a `.env` file in `G_TOKEN` variable. Change the name everywhere if you wish.
   ```js
  G_TOKEN = 'ENTER YOUR PAT';
   ```

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

### How to use

* Move into the project directory from command line tool
* ```sh
myawesometool -h
``` 
for help
* ```sh
myawesometool -i <csv file(with extension)> <package_name@version>
``` 
for taking a csv file and listing out denpendency version satifiability status
* ```sh
myswesometool -i -u <csv file(with extension)> <package_name@version>
``` 
for checking and updating. This required github PAT.
* ```sh
npm test
``` 
is incomplete. currently only fork test is implemented. 
* don't run it outside of the project directory for the time being (will be looked into later)
* A lot(most) of the logic makes no sence (specially asynchoronous ones).This was developed with 'have to work anyhow' in mind and not 'should be logically sound'. 
* Currently the code does not delete the local cloned repository. So delete them manually. Will try to automate as soon as possible 
* There's a sample_d.csv file with two repo links. (optinal)Delete the last 3 columns. First repo doesn't have axios. It's my personal repo. Second one has axios 0.23.0. So for testing test with anything higher than that.
<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Will add more info here. 

_For more examples, please refer to the [Documentation](https://example.com)_
